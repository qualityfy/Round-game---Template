This is a template Lua U script for Roblox allowing you to create a game with intervals and rounds.
For beginners and for guidance, there will be comments instructing you on what you may want to modify and how the script works.

The repository should contain both scripts and a .rbxl save file.
The .rbxl save file may be useful for those who haven't started on their project yet and would like to begin using this template.
